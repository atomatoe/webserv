<p>Summary: This project is here to make you write your own HTTP server. You will follow the real HTTP RFC and you will be able to test it with a real browser. HTTP is one of the most used protocol on internet. Knowing its arcane will be useful, even if you won&rsquo;t be working on a website.</p>
<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser. HTTP was developed to facilitate hypertext and the World Wide Web. The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients. The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer</p>
